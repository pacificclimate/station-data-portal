# This docker-compose uses the following shell environment variables:
#
# `SDP_TAG`: Image tag
# `SDP_PORT`: External port to map to
# Note: These values are set as part of the makefile, initialize the container
# Using it.
#
# Their values are set appropriately in the Makefile for use on a workstation.
# For use in a production setting, either set the shell
# variables appropriately when invoking docker-compose, or modify (a copy of)
# this file with the desired values.
