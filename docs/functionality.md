# Functionality

Eventually this document may expand to be a more complete statement of 
requirements and functionality. For now it contains an assortment of notes
about those topics.

## Selection of area by map polygon

Leaflet, or at least our ability to make it do what we want it to do, seems to
impose the following choice on us:

1. EITHER map polygons can be edited and deleted individually (by clicking on 
  the polygon, rather than by clicking Clear All),
2. OR markers inside a polygon can be interacted with (hover for tootip; 
  click for station info).

At present, we have chosen (1).
