## Production

### Docker

We currently deploy all apps using Docker. 
This project contains [Docker infrastructure](docker) and a 
[GitHub action](.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml) that automatically 
builds and tags a Docker image on each commit. The image name is
`pcic/station-data-portal-frontend`.

### Configuration, environment variables, and Docker

It is best practice to configure a web app externally, at run-time, typically using environment variables for any
simple (atomic, e.g., string) configuration values.

Here we run into a problem introduced by CRA:
CRA injects environment variables only at _build time_, not at run time.
["The environment variables are embedded during the build time. Since Create React App produces a static
HTML/CSS/JS bundle, it can’t possibly read them at runtime."](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables).

We containerize our apps with Docker. A natural approach to deploying apps with Docker is to build the app as
part of the image build, and then just serve it from a container. However, because of CRA's build-time injection
of environment variables, this means that such Docker images cannot be configured at run-time, that is, when
a container is run. Only static, build-time environment variables are available to CRA apps inside such images.

It therefore takes some extra effort to inject run-time environment variables (or configuration generally) into
these Dockerized applications. There are two basic approaches:

1. Build the app, and inject run-time environment variables, as part of the image run (i.e., the command run
   by the image includes building the app, which then has access to environment variables provided via the `docker run`
   command).
    * This is simple but it means that containers are slow to start up and contain a lot of infrastructure
      (Node.js, etc.) needed to build the image. This isn't an issue for us, because we don't start many instances and
      we don't do it often.

2. Fetch the environment variables (or a configuration file) from the server.
    * This approach has several variants, which are outlined in this
      [CRA issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2353).

A key requirement is to be able to configure at run time the the URL at which the app is deployed.
CRA provides a (build-time) environment variable for this, `PUBLIC_URL`.

Option 2 makes setting `PUBLIC_URL` _much_ harder to accomplish, and would require significant changes to the
codebase.

Option 1 makes setting `PUBLIC_URL` simple and requires no change to the codebase;
as noted we don't care about the cost of using such containers.

Therefore we have chosen option 1.

### Deployment

See the contents of the [`docker`](docker) directory for an example of how
to run the SDP Docker image. The [Makefile](Makefile) shows how to run the
image using `docker-compose`. You may wish to copy and modify
`docker-compose.yaml` to construct a production deployment.
